      <h1>I found a dog!</h1>
      <p><em>Public Disgrace<br>
      May 2016</em></p>
      <p>After this hot girl squirted all over me (which had me come as well), he licked my pussy as any slave should do: like he could do it for hours! But it turned me on so much that I came again pretty fast. Then he started cleaning all that juice off my body... with his tongue, of course! Once I was clean, as a good slave, he cleaned up the scene space, picked up my stuff, and heeled as I went off.</p> 
      <p>Oh, I loved this dog! He was not only pretty but also very obedient and would lick my feet every time I ask him. I loved seeing him licking my feet and enjoying it! I walked him around with his leash as he carried my stuff and showed him off to everyone. I was so proud of my good boy! I played with him, teasing him while he was attached to the pole... and when I had had enough, I sat down and made him massage my feet and legs.</p> 
      <p>So relaxing!</p>

      <h1>A slave or a toy? Why not both?!</h1>
      <p><em>Public Disgrace<br>
      May 2018</em></p>
      <p>As I walk through the crowd, followed by my slave (you, at least, need someone to hold your bottle of water!), I found the sweetest little toy! I must say, [@Mz_Claws](https://fetlife.com/Mz_Claws) has an eye for toys! And she shares!! So when I found her new toy alone, I thought I should try it too!</p>
      <p>It had all those ropes tied all around its chest which made it so tempting to just grab them and pull it closer to me! But it still had its hands free, so I asked my slave to tie its hands behind its back. So, once my new toy was all gift wrapped, I pulled on the ropes and made it follow me and my slave upstairs to play.</p>
      <p>So as I sit my toy on the couch, I motion my slave to sit by its side. That way I could have easy access to both of them!</p>
      <p>I love new toys! You get to do whatever you want and discover all their buttons and the sounds they make! Whether you caress, lick, suck, nail, or bite, they always make noises or have nice bodily reactions!</p>
      <p>When I get excited, I like to have a cock in my hand, you know, just to play with, to feel it getting hard and harder... That's mostly what my slave is for, actually. So as I was playing with my new toy, I started massaging my slave's cock... Oh, so much teasing, so much fun!! I love teasing!</p>
      <p>At some point, I got really excited but a bit bored with playing with the toy, so I decided I would have them go down on me! So as they were both, of course, eager to please me, I told them they would then have to take turns. So I grabbed my toy's ropes and pulled it down towards my pussy, and it started licking right away (that's a good, well-functioning toy, right there!). Then I stopped it, and motioned my slave to take its place, and of course, it executed itself promptly and oh competently! (good slaves are so efficient!). Then I switched again,.. and again,... until I came intensely and for as long as I let it suck on my clit... God, that was good!</p>
      <p>And finally, I could slowly recover and enjoy the post-orgasm glow, as both my feet were being massaged by my slave and my toy. What a perfect ending for this memorable night!</p>

      <p>P.S. That's what I call teamwork: a slave AND a toy!</p>

      <h1>(H)appiness</h1>
      <p><em>Opalace - Chill & Play<br>
      July 2023</em></p>
      <p>When I saw it laying there, faking innocence but subtly tempting me, challenging me… I couldn’t help myself. I needed to teach it who’s the Master! Show it how much weight I can throw around!</p>
      <p>Now, blindly stomping your feet won’t get you far, everyone knows that. You need to be smart about your footing and heavily think about your steps before putting your foot down.</p>
      <p>First, I started by complacently swiping it this way and that with my foot as if it were just a weird squishy toy stuck in the ground, unable to escape… I waited to see how it’ll react, but it kept coming back into place, waiting expectantly, obviously anticipating my next move.</p>
      <p>Then I went about massaging it, rhythmically penetrating its flesh with my skillful toes, sensually luring it into submission while I was actually deciphering all its weakest spots.</p>
      <p>So as I was pressing here and there, from this and that way, I could feel under my foot the different parts inside trying to relocate themselves around each other, desperately trying to maintain some sense of wholeness while still shamelessly relishing the intense pressure I was putting it under.</p>
      <p>Still, you need to be careful when trying to fully stand on it; after all, that thing ain’t flat! There are some curves to it that you need to take into account, otherwise, a bit too much this way or not enough that way and you could easily fall off of it! You wouldn’t want to hurt yourself, now would you?!</p>
      <p>Although, I must admit I loved, when I stepped on it wrong, to feel it trying to worm its way out from under my feet; poor little thing, it’s like it doesn’t know what’s good for it! Constantly trying to pin it down for good as it kept wriggling around. A sensual cat-and-mouse kinda chase; except you know and you can actually feel that the mouse really is hoping for you to finally squish it under your heel!</p>
      <p>Finally, if you position yourself properly, and apply the right pressure, keeping the angle steady, you can feel and see how happy it gets! Finally kept in its rightful place: squashed under its Master’s feet. That’s when I started dancing and grinding a bit in order to really imprint my victory into it.</p>
      <p>Seriously, it’s so much prettier when it’s all flattened, devoided of all its useless brawniness, crushed by the superiority of my boot! Especially since, afterward, you get to see the lines of my sole imprinted on it! Like my signature; it's Master’s autograph. However, the next days do hold a whole new delight as it gets to show off all the nice little blue and purple spots that you’ve so generously bestowed upon all over it! Proudly sharing these pictures is really how (h)appiness thanks you!</p>
      <p>You’re welcome.</p>
