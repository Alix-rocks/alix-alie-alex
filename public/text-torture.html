      <h1>Torture</h1>
      <p>
        The sky is blue, the sun's shining.<br>
        People walking, yet here I am,<br>
        Still standing there, on the sidewalk<br>
        Facing the door and freaking out!<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>Yep, here I am, facing my own hell's door, arguing with myself whether or not to go in.</p>
      <p>"It's been too long now, you HAVE to do it."</p>
      <p>"Nah, it's not that bad, I'm sure I can tough it out for another month or two."</p>
      <p>"No way, in a month or two, you'll be too busy to come back. You have to do it now... So let's just suck it up and go in!"</p>
      <p>Yet, I stay still, looking diffidently at the door in front of me. That door looks just like every other business door, with the opening hours written on a board and the Interac and PULL stickers near the handle. Nothing scary. Still, I couldn't quite open it. Dread was freezing me.</p>
      <p>"I have to!", I repeated to myself.</p>
      <p>True, every once in a while, although as rarely as I could have it, I have to face my fear and do it. The narcissistic part of me kind of wanted to (what a traitor!!)... But still, the rest of me was just too traumatized by all the previous experiences. The end result would, should, be enjoyable, but the process to get there was, and I knew that to the bottom of my being, just too painful.</p>
      <p>So there I was, still on the sidewalk, in the late afternoon, after a full day of work, looking blankly at the door, my heart beating too fast, my hands wet and my head getting dizzy...</p>
      <p>"Ok, come on! You'll have to do it sooner or later, so might as well do it now!" I scolded myself one last time, trying to summon what little courage I could muster.</p>
      <p>So, straightening my back and clenching my teeth, I finally opened the door and walked in...</p>
      <p>Once I got in and my eyes had adjusted to the gory lights, I could see the dreadful chairs, the tables with all those creepy instruments, and... them. There were three of them, Machiavellianly chatting, probably about their last victim. I don't know if they're a different species or just heartless sadists convinced they're doing the world a favor torturing innocent people, but I've never quite understood them and yes, they kind of scare me. The three of them immediately turned my way, ingrainedly beckoned by the opening door chant, and as soon as they saw me, you could see the light glowing in their eyes, the sheer eagerness of the predator seeing its next prey. But they must have some telepathic powers because they didn't even need to confer to decide which one of them would have me. In less time than it should have taken, two of them turned back towards each other, resuming their disturbing chatter as the third one kept looking at me, intensely. Slowly grinning into that deceiving half welcoming, half bloodthirsty smile, my supposedly assigned torturer waves a hand coaxing me to take a seat in one of the lower chairs...</p>
      <p>Oh, by the way, you need to understand that these chairs are like torturing devices in themselves. When you sit down in those chairs you have to slouch down so that when you lean on the back of the chair (with no lower back support, might I add), your head ends up hanging in midair, supported only by your neck. But the thing is that the edge under your neck is cold and hard so you can't let your neck rest on it without it getting into your skin and so you have to support all your head's weight yourself. Let's just say it's tricky and tiresomely painful. But that cramped position is only the beginning because then, as you've never been so uncomfortably seated, all stiff and aching, there comes the water. First, it comes out freezing cold but gradually gets warmer so at one point you start having some hope, that maybe you might get to relax into it. But as soon as you start letting your guard down, the water gets so hot you wish it would go back to being cold. But as they say, be careful what you wish for. Because then the water just keeps switching between painfully cold and frighteningly hot over and over again, plus constantly threatening to get into your eyes, your ears, your nose. And as they're trying to either drown you or drive you crazy (who knows?!) with the watery torture, they always add this slimy nauseatingly smelly stuff on your head which scent, added to their usually strong and cheap perfume, becomes pure gaging material. But that's not all, that's just the ambiance being put together for the real torture: the nails, long and sharp, scratching and scraping, trying to scalp you. Because, evidently, what better way to get that oozy stuff to "penetrate" if not with their nails!? And, of course, there's nothing you can do. Try to move and it’ll just get worst anyway. So you suffer in silence hoping it'll be over soon.</p>
      <p>Although, once it's over, you're still just up for the second part. The only thing is that you need to be in another chair. So they make you walk the walk of cold wet shame all across the place and sit down in front of a big mirror near a table full of sharp and creepy instruments... Clearly, they love to be able to watch you suffer from every angle, otherwise, there wouldn't be that many mirrors. So, as you're seating there, looking at yourself all beaten up and covered in cold sweats, wondering why the hell you opened that door in the first place, they dare ask you with that creepy enthusiasm of theirs:</p>
      <p>"So, what will it be?"</p>
      <p>As if there's no way you could just don't want to be there. Is a choice really a choice if all the options are equally painful? But, obviously, if you went through all of that first part, it has to be for a reason, right?! So you have to specify which one it is, but that's the tricky part! Because, you see, if you're not clear enough; if they don't really understand what you want or if you ask for the wrong one... Well, let's just say you'll be facing excruciating regrets. So as you're looking at them in the big mirror in front of you, knowing they're waiting not so patiently for your answer, all you try to do is make sense of the mental picture you've been building up in your mind for the past weeks. But even though you've practiced explaining it, knowing that day would come, with your heart beating too fast, armpits sweating and brain getting mushier by the stress and fear of not being clear enough, all you can do is stupidly repeat the only two words you remember from their language and tumbling on all the other words. Hopefully, at some point, they'll stop your rambling declaring that they'd got it, but then a mix of relief and dread just freezes your mouth midword. Because that's it, once they're started, there's no stopping them, no turning back. What if they got it all wrong?!</p>
      <p>Then, as if they read your mind, the first thing they want to do is to confirm that, even though they will be doing what they think you asked for, they will still be in charge the whole time. So, putting a gown over your shoulders, they'll simply tie it tight enough around your neck to "gently" choke you, therefore efficiently asserting their dominant position while also making sure no blood would stain your clothes. How convenient. We wouldn't want any visible proof now, would we?</p>
      <p>And then, they always end up saying the four words that any nearsighted person would fear the most in an unfamiliar situation:</p>
      <p>"Take off your glasses."</p>
      <p>Believe me, when you're unable to see anything further than four inches away, you quickly feel defenseless. So helpless, alone in your blurry world. You can't make out what's around you, let alone who's coming at you nor how. But, teeth clenched and hands shaking, you still hand them out your glasses, because you know the alternative would be much worse. You can't just stop now. Not after everything you've already just been through. But once they have your glasses, they always put them on the table, out of your reach, way too far for your comfort or sanity. But by then it's too late to change your mind, they're on a roll. And the real torture can finally start.</p>
      <p>The first cut is the worst. It's not supposed to hurt that much yet; it's just one little chop. But I swear you can hear it. The ominous sound of the point of no return; a dreadful chomp defining that decisive moment, the beginning of the end. Whether it's the sound or the sensation, your whole being gets that deep down knowledge that THIS IS IT. Like the ominous sound of the locking click of your prison cell door. Doom.</p>
      <p>Then the show is on and there's nothing you can do about it except suffer in silence. Because no, you're not supposed to scream nor even whine. Grown-ups don't cry. So you let them have their fun with you. Repeatedly and mercilessly rattling your scalp like they'd want to shred your skin off your skull. Pulling at your hair like they're trying to rip your head off and nearly tearing your ears off in the process. Constantly switching through unidentifiable devices and always agitating them way too close to your eyes. The pain gets more excruciating every time they use a new instrument. The panic sips through you for not seeing what they're really doing to you, fearing the unknown results. Your breath gets more and more labored from the choking collar and your whole body shivers from the still-wet hair. And all you can do is stare at your hands resting defeated on your lap. They're the only part of your body that you can still more or less see clearly, bringing you what little comfort it could; confirming you're still you, human and alive, despite the distress, pain, and unknownness of the fuzzy veil surrounding you... But every time your head would slightly bend down for looking too closely at your lap, they'll firmly grab it and put it back up, uttering something like:</p>
      <p>"Keep your head up straight, or you'll regret it!"</p>
      <p>So you can't even have that little comfort. Meanwhile, as you're trying to cope with the fear, the tearing pain, and the helplessness of your situation... They talk. Chatting and rambling about meaningless things (probably their own life); talking like they like to hear their own voice way too much; like they don't even need you to listen... Yeah, they keep mindlessly torturing you, not caring at all about your excruciating suffering, focusing on whatever story they're telling you about, and sadistically enjoying themselves. Some people really have no heart. Or maybe they really think you're enjoying yourself and are interested in their life? How can someone be so clueless?!</p>
      <p>Anyway, that's not the worst. Once in a while, they would pause and look in the mirror. Yeah, that's bad. Because, since their reflection is too blurry for you, you can't tell if they're looking at you, waiting for an answer to some vague question you hadn't heard or if they're just admiring their bloody work from this other perspective. So, every time, you kind of froze, your brain going miles a minute trying to figure out what you're supposed to do. Are you supposed to say something? And if you are, what are you supposed to say? What if you say the wrong thing? Personally, just in case, threading on the safe side, I usually opt for a shy lopsided smile, hoping that could mean anything and thus everything they're hoping for. Dare you offend them! Because only God knows how worse this all could get!</p>
      <p>After what will have seemed like hours, they'll suddenly stop assailing you and start walking away. A wave of relief will instantly spread through you. Freedom, at last! Your breath will start to slow down and your jaw will try to relax. Your shoulders will most certainly slouch, exhaustion finally taking its toll.</p>
      <p>But as you stretch your arm towards the table trying to reach for your glasses, they'll be coming back out of nowhere and stop you:</p>
      <p>"Hold on, I'm not finished yet!"</p>
      <p>That's when your whole body freezes, petrified, arm still stretched midair, eyes widened in fear, and breath stuck somewhere in your chest. And yet, you know you should have known! Every time, you naively hope that they would skip that last part...</p>
      <p>After the freezing/burning and drowning, the blinding and choking, the scratching and pulling, comes, of course, the deafening and sickening. As they start blasting you with that hot air-blowing contraption, they even resume the pulling and scratching. As if you hadn't had enough yet. Soon, the blasted warmth, probably helped by your exhausted state, starts making you feel sick and dizzy. Plus, the screeching high-pitched noise coming from the torture device keeps aggressing your ears and slowly driving you insane. But once you’ve realized that all that roaring deafening noise would definitely cover any scream for help; that hope is now both deaf and dead; that's when you usually, finally, reach the breaking point. The point where your body and mind just give up, where you stop hopefully fighting and start defeatedly shutting off. You’ve crossed the line past which nothing matters anymore; you don't feel the pain nor the fear anymore. You don't feel anything. Almost blissful, really.</p>
      <p>After you'll have no idea how long, they'll finally stop, take a step back, look at their chef-d'oeuvre and, with a radiant satisfied smile on their face, claim their victory:</p>
      <p>"Done!"</p>
      <p>Still dazed and numbed, you won't even care what the results are anymore. Part of you won't even realize that the torture is finally over and that you should get the hell out of there. Hopefully, your subconscious will be smarter and take over. So without really knowing it, you'll put your glasses that they've finally given you back on and stumble off of the chair. Then you'll probably smile for their benefits in the big mirror before mindlessly walking to the cash register. Still not registering what they're saying (probably gloating anyway), you'll get your credit card out. Because, yeah, you actually have to pay for that. Then, once the insult has been added to the injury, your body and mind still numbed from the endless torture, you'll finally walk towards the exit, fixing that door, subconsciously seeking freedom.</p>
      <p><br>
        The sky is blue, the sun's shining.<br>
        People walking, yet here I am,<br>
        Still standing there, on the sidewalk<br>
        Facing my life, ruling straight out<br>
        That pain ain't worth beauty nor greed,<br>
        That no haircut I'll ever need.
